Bit6 is a real-time, cloud-based communications-as-a-service platform that allows mobile and web application developers to quickly and easily add voice/video calling, texting, and multimedia messaging capabilities into their apps.

### Live Demos
We have two live demos that you can try right now:

1. [demo.bit6.com](http://demo.bit6.com) - click on 'Signup' and create a username. Open another browser window and login as a different user. You will be able to chat and make video calls between the browsers.

2. [videocalls.io](https://videocalls.io) - one-click video calling with your Facebook friends. Go to [videocalls.io](https://videocalls.io), click 'Start Calling'. You will see a list of your friends who have done the same. Click on a friend's name to start a video call.

The source code for these apps is included in the JS SDK.
