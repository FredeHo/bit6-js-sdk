Bit6 also supports anonymous users. This is useful for situations where a user does not have an account, for example, if you want to have chatting with web visitors.

Bit6 app needs to be configured to support anonymous users. This is done with `auth_anonymous` app setting which can be set via a backend API or the developer portal. It specifies the TTL (time-to-live) value for the anonymous users. After user's TTL value expires, all the user data is deleted from the servers.

### Sign in as an anonymous user

```js
b6.session.anonymous(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('error', err);
  }
  else {
    console.log('signed in');
  }
});
```
