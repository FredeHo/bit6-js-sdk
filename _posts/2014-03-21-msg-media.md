### Send a Photo, Video or Audio Message

You can easily send a rich media message by attaching a file to an outgoing message. The file handle can be obtained using:

  - file upload `<input type="file">` - see [sample](https://github.com/bit6/bit6-js-sdk/blob/master/samples/demo/js/demo.js#L714),
  - drag and drop events - [sample](https://github.com/bit6/bit6-js-sdk/blob/master/samples/demo/js/demo.js#L723), or
  - handling `paste` events for a text field - [sample](https://github.com/bit6/bit6-js-sdk/blob/master/samples/demo/js/demo.js#L770)


Once you have a `file` object, sending a message is super simple. Note that the attached file can be uploaded directly to your AWS S3 bucket without touching Bit6 servers.

```javascript
b6.compose('usr:john').text('Hello!').attach(file).send(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('error', err);
  }
  else {
    console.log('message sent');
  }
});
```

### Processing a Message

A Message represents a text message, media message or a call history item.

Please check the [sample code](https://github.com/bit6/bit6-js-sdk/blob/master/samples/demo/js/demo.js#L219) that shows how to handle various message types.
